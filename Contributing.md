> This document is in the process of being written. For now, if you are new to Git/GitHub and need help with the contributing process, ask me (Cobalt, aka `cobaltscorner`) directly in [the Discord server](https://cobaltscorner.org/discord).
## What You'll Need
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account that you are fine with being displayed up in public contribution records
- The [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version control system
- The [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) app to authenticate with GitHub
- The [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Markdown notes editor (this is technically optional but highly recommended)
## Setup
1. Install all of the required software from the links provided above.
2. Open the [GitHub website](https://github.com/login) and sign into your account. If you do not have an account, create one.
3. To edit the knowledgebase, you'll need first to copy it to your own account, which is called "forking" in GitHub terms. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/cobaltscorner/knowledgebase/fork) to make a personal copy.
4. Open GitHub Desktop and sign into your account.
5. In GitHub Desktop, select your forked copy of the knowledgebase from the displayed list, then click **Clone \<repository\>**. Note the folder in the **Local Path** field, as you'll need to find it in the next step.
6. Open Obsidian, click **Open folder as vault**, and select the repository folder you downloaded from your files.
7. Go into Obsidian's settings and under **Community plugins** click **Turn on community plugins**.
8. Navigate to the [Git plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-git) and install it.
## Submitting a Contribution
> Some vocabulary you're going to need to understand the contribution process:
> 1. **Commit** - make a save point in your editing history
> 2. **Push** - upload all your commits to GitHub (to your fork, not the main repository)
> 3. **Pull** - sync your local copy of the repository with your online copy
> 4. **Pull request (PR)** - submit your writing to the main repository for review

> To be continued.
