## About the Knowledgebase
Welcome to the Cobalt's Corner knowledgebase. This repository represents the collaborative writings of our movement - mostly on broader topics like political theory and strategy, though contributions relating to current and past events are welcome.
### For Readers
If you'd like to read about our ideas, this is the place to do it. It's recommended that you view this knowledgebase in Obsidian, but you can simply explore it on GitHub if you're not familiar with Obsidian or don't know how to download the repository. In the future, we hope to publish these notes on a dedicated site with a more user-friendly reader experience.
### For Contributors
If you'd like to contribute, you'll need to learn how to use a bit of software to submit your work. Visit the [Contributing](Contributing.md) guide for more information on how to set up and use Git and GitHub.
## About the Movement
We believe the American left has going through an identity crisis. We are looking for people who are willing to dedicate time to solving this crisis, who are ready to combat forces on the right and the left with conviction, and who are not afraid of getting involved. Our movement is called *The Way Forward*. If you're interested, start by joining [our Discord server](https://cobaltscorner.org/discord). For more technical information about the movement and its goals, read the [Mission Statement](<Mission Statement.md>).
