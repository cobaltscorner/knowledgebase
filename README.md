## About the Knowledgebase
Welcome to the Cobalt's Corner knowledgebase. This repository represents the collaborative writings of our movement - mostly on broader topics like political theory and strategy, though contributions relating to current and past events are welcome.
### For Readers
If you'd like to read about our ideas, this is the place to do it. It's recommended that you view this knowledgebase in Obsidian, but you can simply explore it on GitHub if you're not familiar with Obsidian or don't know how to download the repository. In the future, we hope to publish these notes on a dedicated site with a more user-friendly reader experience.
### For Contributors
If you'd like to contribute, you'll need to install the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Markdown editor, as well as the [Git](https://git-scm.com) version control system. Visit the [[Contributing]] guide for more information on how to set up and use Git and GitHub.

When you make a contribution, it will be evaluated by a staff member based on its quality, factual accuracy, and pertinence to our movement. If there are issues with your contribution that we feel are fixable, we will either ask you to make edits, or we will make those edits for you and ask for your approval to finalize the submission. If there are irreconcilable issues with your submission, it will be rejected.

Writing topics should pertain to politics, and should be written within the bounds of our mission. Broadly, this means that arguing in support of illiberal forms of government, or against electoral politics, is not acceptable. There may be a time and a place for having these kinds of discussions, but this is not it.
## About the Movement
Here at Cobalt's Corner, we believe the American left has going through an identity crisis. We are looking for people who are willing to dedicate time to solving this crisis, who are ready to combat forces on the right and the left with conviction, and who are not afraid of getting involved. If you're interested, start by joining [our Discord server](https://cobaltscorner.org/discord).
